An example of Coq plugin that provides a tactic that generalize the
vm_compute tactic, such that it is possible to use it when existential
variables appear in the goal. 

It also makes it possible to recover some kind of opacity by
abstracting over some definitions that appear in the goal (instances
of these definitions that appear through computations are going to be
expanded, though).

For instance, 
\[
evm blacklist [plus] 
\]

in the goal 

\[
5 * 4 + ?3 
\]

reduces to 

\[
20 + ?3
\]
